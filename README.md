# CREATiVMiNDS
This is a React app developed as a proof-of-concept demo for a web-based children's game. The objective of the game was to teach science concepts to elementary school students using a module customized for their personal learning styles. It also features a collaborative component at the end where students have to work as a team to complete the module. 

In this demo, we use a module called "Escape the Tower" to deliver a lesson on simple machines and pulleys.

Note: This is not a functional game as yet. It is a low-fidelity prototype of what such an application could look like.
